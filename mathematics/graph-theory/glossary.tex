\longnewglossaryentry{complete graph}{name=complete graph}
{%
  A simple undirected \gls{graph} in which every pair of distinct \glspl{vertex} is connected by a unique \glspl{edge}.
}

\longnewglossaryentry{graph}{name=graph}
{%
  A data structure $\mathcal{K}$ consisting of a set of \glspl{node} $\mathcal{X}=\{X_1,\dots,X_n\}$ and a set of \glspl{edge}.
}

\longnewglossaryentry{node}{name=node}
{%
  A fundamental unit of which graphs are formed.
}

\longnewglossaryentry{edge}{name=edge}
{%
  A pair of \glspl{node} $X_i,X_j$ can be connected by an directed edge $X_i\to X_j$ or $X_j\to X_i$, or by an undirected edge $X_i\undedge X_j$.

  If an edge can either be directed or undirected, we write $X_i\rightleftharpoons X_j$.
}

\longnewglossaryentry{subgraph}{name=subgraph}
{%
  A \gls{graph} which is associated with a subset of nodes from another graph.
}

\longnewglossaryentry{complete subgraph}{name=complete subgraph}
{%
  A \gls{subgraph} over a set of \glspl{node} $\bm{X}$ is complete if every two nodes in $\bm{X}$ are connected by some \gls{edge}. $\bm{X}$ is called a \gls{clique}.
}

\longnewglossaryentry{clique}{name=clique}
{%
  A set of \gls{node} which form a \gls{complete subgraph}.

  A clique is maximal if for any superset of \glspl{node} $\bm{Y}\supset\bm{X}$, $\bm{Y}$ is not a clique.
